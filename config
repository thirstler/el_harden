# CONFIGURATION

# These are some basic (and global) configuration options that aren't likely to
# differ between selected profiles.

# Script adds an administrative user by default. Set ADMIN_USER to nothing if
# you don't want an admin user added. Change username and/or UID here.
ADMIN_USER=secfix_admin

##
#                   !!!!!!!!! CHANGE ME !!!!!!!!!!!
# Set password hash for the above mentioned administrative user. This file is
# distributed with password: 'b3292f' (without quotes).  On RHEL 6/7 use
# something like this to generate a hash:
#   python -c "import crypt; print crypt.crypt('b3292f')"

# affect the root user in any way and DISABLE_ROOT and ROOT_PASSWD are ignored.

# ROOT_PASSWORD directive is ignored. ROOT_PASSWD should be set to the root
# password hash if we're dot disabling the root account.
